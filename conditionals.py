# If/ Else conditions are used to decide to do something based on something being true or false

# Membership Operators (in, not in) - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object

# Identity Operators (is, is not) - Compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
